# Glowbougs: a js13k entry by Mr Speaker

Find and trap the mysterious Glowbougs, deep underground. Use your arrow keys to run and jump, fire your spears for self defence as well as scaling the tricky terrain. Find traps scattered around labyrinth - and activate them (hold "down" and "fire) under a Glowboug. If you ensnare one, it will point you in the direction of pieces of grail. The pieces you so desire...
